This is the accompanying code for our EMNLP 2019 paper (citation will be added after the conference
proceedings are out.)

This code has two steps:
- Step 1: data delexicalization code which is kept under the `tagging/` folder
- Step 2: using that data to do training/testing using neuralnetworks which is kept under the `nn/` folder.

Please refer to the instructions in the respective folders.
