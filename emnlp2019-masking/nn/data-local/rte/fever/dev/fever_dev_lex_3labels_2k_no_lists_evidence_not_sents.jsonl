Edgar Allan Poe -LRB- -LSB- po\u028a -RSB- born Edgar Poe ; January 19 , 1809 -- October 7 , 1849 -RRB- was an American writer , editor , and literary critic . Poe died in Baltimore on October 7 , 1849 , at age 40 ; the cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to alcohol , brain congestion , cholera , drugs , heart disease , rabies , suicide , tuberculosis , and other agents . Poe was born in Boston , the second child of two actors . They never formally adopted him , but Poe was with them well into young adulthood . Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name . Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals , becoming known for his own style of literary criticism . Poe attended the University of Virginia for one semester but left due to lack of money . In Richmond in 1836 , he married Virginia Clemm , his 13-year-old cousin . However , Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point , declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer , and he ultimately parted ways with John Allan . Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar repeatedly clashed over debts , including those incurred by gambling , and the cost of secondary education for the young man . He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone , resulting in a financially difficult life and career . It was at this time that his publishing career began , albeit humbly , with the anonymous collection of poems Tamerlane and Other Poems -LRB- 1827 -RRB- , credited only to `` a Bostonian '' . Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories , particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre . Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction . His work forced him to move among several cities , including Baltimore , Philadelphia , and New York City .

{"claim": "Babe Ruth was a person .", "evidence": "Ruth established many MLB batting -LRB- and some pitching -RRB- records , including career home runs -LRB- 714 -RRB- , runs batted in -LRB- RBIs -RRB- -LRB- 2,213 -RRB- , bases on balls -LRB- 2,062 -RRB- , slugging percentage -LRB- .6897 -RRB- , and on-base plus slugging -LRB- OPS -RRB- -LRB- 1.164 -RRB- ; the latter two still stand today . Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time . He retired in 1935 after a short stint with the Boston Braves . During his career , Ruth led the AL in home runs during a season twelve times . By 1916 , he had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs , a feat unusual for any player in the pre-1920 dead-ball era . In his final years , Ruth made many public appearances , especially in support of American efforts in World War II . In his 15 years with New York , Ruth helped the Yankees win seven American League -LRB- AL -RRB- championships and four World Series championships . After that season , Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Ruth to the Yankees amid controversy . Ruth 's legendary power and charismatic personality made him a larger-than-life figure in the Roaring Twenties . After his retirement as a player , he was denied a managerial job in baseball , most likely due to poor behavior during parts of his playing career . His often reckless lifestyle was tempered by his willingness to do good by visiting children at hospitals and orphanages . With regular playing time , he broke the MLB single-season home run record in 1919 . In , Ruth was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its `` first five '' inaugural members . As part of the Yankees ' vaunted `` Murderer 's Row '' lineup of 1927 , Ruth hit 60 home runs , extending his MLB single-season record . During his career , he was the target of intense press and public attention for his baseball exploits and off-field penchants for drinking and womanizing . In 1914 , Ruth was signed to play minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles but was soon sold to the Red Sox . Nicknamed `` The Bambino '' and `` The Sultan of Swat '' , he began his MLB career as a stellar left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox , but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees . Although Ruth twice won 23 games in a season as a pitcher and was a member of three World Series championship teams with Boston , he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder . At age seven , Ruth was sent to St. Mary 's Industrial School for Boys , a reformatory where he learned life lessons and baseball skills from Brother Matthias Boutlier of the Christian Brothers , the school 's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player . His big swing led to escalating home run totals that not only drew fans to the ballpark and boosted the sport 's popularity but also helped usher in the live-ball era of baseball , in which it evolved from a low-scoring game of strategy to a sport where the home run was a major factor .

The Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation 's second - and fifth-most populous urban regions , respectively . Though California is well-known for its warm Mediterranean climate , the large size of the state means it can vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north , to arid desert in the interior , as well as snowy alpine in the mountains .

California 's diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast in the west to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in the east ; and from the redwood -- Douglas fir forests in the northwest to the Mojave Desert in the southeast . California also has the nation 's most populous county , Los Angeles County , and its largest county by area , San Bernardino County . Its three main drainage systems are the Sacramento Valley in the north , which receives well over 20 in of rain annually ; the drier San Joaquin Valley in the south , and the Tulare Basin and its semi-arid desert climate at the southernmost end . The Central Valley , a major agricultural area , dominates the state 's center . The Spanish Empire then claimed it as part of Alta California in their New Spain colony . Located in southeast California , the thinly populated deserts and mountains of this vast county stretch from where the bulk of the county population resides in two Census County Divisions , some 1,422,745 people as of the 2010 Census , covering the 450 square miles -LRB- 1,166 km2 -RRB- south of the San Bernardino Mountains in San Bernardino Valley , to the Nevada border and the Colorado River .", "label": "AGREE"}
